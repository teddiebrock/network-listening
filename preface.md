<h2>Listening to the Inaudible: Navigating Networks Through Poetry and Field Recording</h2>

 
Within the context of Vancouver’s geography as a port city, the poems in Shazia Hafiz Ramji’s <i>Port of Being</i> examine the interplay between intimacy and distance, sight and sound, and the human and the non-human, thus constructing a simultaneously spatial, sonic, and affectual map of possibilities for re-orienting oneself in relation to technological and social infrastructure.

While Ramji draws attention to the role of sound and listening in her own poetic-compositional practice, which she contextualizes in the collection’s notes, the section titled “Container” most overtly engages with practices of documentary field recording. These poems catalogue and reconfigure the assortment of agents, social forces, and material structures that constitute the city as a multilayered network of relations. 

As Redell Olson writes, a poetics of field recording, or, in other words, the “felt listening towards the recording in writing” can be understood as “itself a mode of attention, an attentively angled methodology of textual practice that reverberates with a poetics of sonority not ‘sound just for itself’ but an environmental, political and social encounter between the writer and the world around them” (186). By conceiving of field recording practice within the process of literary composition, Ramji’s poems therefore point to hybrid modes of listening in order to encounter abstracted structures that have become increasingly difficult to locate, represent, resist, and also transform.

Drawing from Ramji’s poetics of network listening, my own project aims to explore the entanglements between subjectivity, urban space, and wireless networks by tending to both poetry and field recording’s orientation to sound and listening, and to consider them as potentially interrelated practices of social and material investigation. 

Rather than highlight only the sensory immediacy of the city’s sights and sounds, the second part of this project is attuned to what media theorist Shintaro Miyazaki calls “algorhythms,” ubiquitous machinic procedures that are typically invisible and inaudible, but play a crucial role in shaping material and social reality. 

To investigate these hidden algorhythms alongside acoustic sounds, I recorded the various locations referenced in Ramji’s text using a device designed to make audible wide-spectrum electromagnetic signals emitted from a range of surrounding technologies. 

In this way, my parallel field recording practice approaches <i>Port of Being</i>—particularly the poems in “Container”—as an aesthetic and theoretical map for an expanded sonic inquiry into the multilayered textures, tendencies, and peripheries of the city as a network of material and social forces.
