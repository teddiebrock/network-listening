<h3>Navigating Networks Through Poetry and Field Recording.</h3>

Drawing from Shazia Hafiz Ramji’s 2018 poetry collection,<i> Port of Being,</i> this project aims to explore the entanglements between subjectivity, urban space, and wireless networks by tending to both poetry and field recording’s orientation to sound and listening. In this way, the project conceives of writing and recording together as interrelated practices of social and material investigation into abstract systems.
