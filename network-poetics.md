<h2>Listening Towards a Poetics of Networks: Shazia Hafiz Ramji’s <i>Port of Being</i></h2>

![vancouver map - clean](/images/vancouver_map_clean.png)

The poems in Ramji’s collection <i>Port of Being</i> draw attention to the entanglements of affect, geography, and network technologies in the context of the port city of Vancouver, Canada. In particular, the text engages with modes of listening that highlight the frequently abstracted means by which not only the technology and infrastructure of networks, but also the imaginaries surrounding them, constitute and reproduce, as Kate Crawford writes, “a form of exercising power, and a way of seeing” (18). Recent critiques by researchers and social scientists such as Wendy Hui Kyong Chung, Joy Buolamwini, Safiya U. Noble, Ruha Benjamin, and Kate Crawford have addressed the uneven distribution of power that coincides with the increased ubiquity and reliance on computational processes in the regulation of everyday life—from social media surveillance to predictive policing algorithms. Within the context of such critiques, <i>Port of Being</i> attends closely to the contradictory experience of negotiating what it means to navigate, inhabit, embrace, or resist the material and dematerialized infrastructures that make up these lived technological conditions. 

Ramji’s poetics of networks engage aesthetically with these conditions as they examine the edges, peripheries, gaps, and glitches that characterize networked infrastructures and wireless subjectivity as relational, fragmented, and fragile phenomena. I draw from Alexandrine Boudreault-Fournier and Kyle Devine’s understanding of infrastructures to include “systems of knowledge and classification, measures and standards, storage and retrieval” that “act as media that allow particular ideological and aesthetic projects to emerge” (4). In this way, network infrastructures—including the material implications of the imaginaries that surround and mobilize them—thus consist of “both things and the relations between things” with “layered, recursive properties” that frequently exceed the grasp of normative sight and hearing (5). 

The poems included within <i>Port of Being</i>’s “Container” section shift across modalities of both seeing and listening through an observational mode that resembles techniques of documentary field recording. This compositional approach also recalls Vancouver’s role in the history of sound recording practice and research, particularly the “soundscape” work of R. Murray Schafer, Barry Truax, and Hildegard Westerkamp in the 1960s and 1970s. In these poems, the sights and sounds of the city are subjectively captured and reassembled as a means to investigate and interrogate underlying social and material relationships that are otherwise concealed or abstracted. For instance, the transient sensory detail of light seizing “glass on glass” at once reveals the material construction of the downtown Harbour Centre, as well as the “stolen bottle of liquor,” which instigates a violent street attack (10). Alongside this scene of visible violence, the poem simultaneously addresses the exploitative ‘slow’ violence of the globalized factory labor that produced one of the attacker’s “peach boxers / with Tommy Hilfiger around its band” (10). The opaque qualities of networks and their surrounding infrastructures are thus apprehended in this section through a practice of situated listening, as Ramji draws attention to the relationship between the act of ‘recording’ urban space and the positionality of the listener, whose geographical and affective orientations shift and respond in relation to a greater network of forces and agents. 

Each poem is introduced with lines of faded text that are primarily “borrowed,” as Ramji highlights in the collection’s endnotes, from the “overheard conversations on the buses, streets, and port of Vancouver” (77). Ramji’s reference to “borrowing” to describe this compositional strategy suggests that the linguistic material—the “snippets of speech” that “open this book”—which constitute these poems will eventually be returned to their original owners (76). Meanwhile, the phrases’ faded and italicized presentation further highlights their “borrowed” status as framing devices, drawing attention back to their originating contexts, even as they generate semantic and affective points of connection and disconnection with the rest of the poem. Reflecting on a scene of potential emergency, one of the section’s anonymized speakers recalls how “[p]eople just changed” as the “sirens went on” (12). This brief insight into a memory marked by fragmentation thus creates an oblique dialogue with the poem’s speaker, who contemplates their own agency toward the violence of systems through which physical bodies are “ordered to harvest,” just as corresponding ‘selves’ are retrieved through “passwords and logins at the border” (12). By the end of the text, however, Ramji clarifies that this excerpt was taken from an interview in The Guardian with football player Dejan Lovren, who recounts his experience as a refugee from the Bosnian war. Regardless of the extent to which the originating contexts of these soundbites have been mediated or fully accounted for, the ghostly presence of these conversational excerpts therefore places emphasis on their simultaneous state of belonging and unbelonging within the materiality of the newly created poetic object. Additionally, this gesture also draws parallels to the extractive and appropriative tendencies that generate meaning within contemporary network culture through the incessant circulation and recombination of texts. 

Here eavesdropping, or the intentional “overhearing” that constitutes these poems, thus operates as an aesthetic technique for investigating the porous boundaries between public and private, and between urban subjects as nodes in a greater network. As a subject caught up in the dense network of human and nonhuman forces, such strategies of “overhearing”—of listening from a place “of vantage” without being seen—as Peter Szendy writes, appear to align with a “proliferating polyphony of listening,” resembling characteristics of telephone lines that are “connected, redouble themselves, interfere with each other, and sometimes get blurred” (All Ears 14-15). The detached warning to “[w]atch your step” demonstrates this aesthetic of “overhearing” in the context of one such poem, which considers the implications of modes of surveillance at various scales—from the “smiles and gazes” at “coffee and brunch” to the “cowardly operations called covert / called murder” (13). This brief imperative, which forms part of the poem yet also exists outside of it, takes on this aspect of “redoubling” through over-hearing, as both the absent target of this statement and the question of its positioning—whether the phrase is being heard from inside one’s consciousness or in a public space, for example—reflects an atmosphere of paranoia evoked by the ubiquitous, yet evasive forms of contemporary surveillance that constitute multiple and simultaneous modes of watching, listening, and recording.

In the poem beginning with the phrase “That’s a nickel toward my dinner,” Ramji’s speaker also considers the origins and circulation of transported goods that are processed through the port of Vancouver. The disconnection between the organic materiality of consumer products—the multifaceted origins of their extraction, use, and afterlife as resources in the context of the city—and their status within a technologized “condition of flow” is articulated through a “syntax of ports gridded in aerial Lego” (7). Through this perspective, the city is encountered as an assemblage of “parts obscured from view,” echoing what Alberto Toscano and Jeff Kinkle call “the poetics of containerization” (Ramji 7; Toscano & Kinkle ch. 6). As Toscano and Kinkle state, the incorporation of the shipping container into modern trade systems has accelerated the “volume, speed, and scope” of capitalist globalisation through the political and aesthetic features of “standardisation, homogeneity, modularity, fungibility, and efficiency” (ch. 6). In this way, the poem’s panoramic yet discontinuous perspective catalogues the constituent “parts” of the city assemblage as it dwells, if only momentarily, on the situations and various agents that animate daily life: a man drinking coffee outside Starbucks; a Port Authority worker putting his arm around another; a stranger’s smile on the bus to Dunbar Street; a witnessed attack in front of the downtown Harbour Centre. However, the speaker’s line of sight (and hearing) also shifts elliptically across time and space as it illuminates the underlying and abstracted systems that influence, and at times even dictate, this array of urban rhythms along a spectrum of violences as well as intimacies. Through this uneasy traversal across instances marked by both fragmentation and connection, the subjects that are caught in the speaker’s networked sightlines nevertheless press up against the omnipresent processes of their ‘containerization.’ As such, this perspective reveals the ways in which these material and social relationships exceed containment within the ‘cell-form’ or ‘box-form’ as a “dumb, indifferent, interchangeable materialisation of capital’s abstract circulation” (ch. 6). 

Therefore, this promise of full logistical visibility, which coincides with automated “just in time” production and distribution systems, creates the conditions by which “physical material ideally behaves more like information,” as Keller Easterling observes (qtd. in Toscano and Kinkle ch. 6). However, within the “fantasy of frictionless integration,” embodied by the image of untethered resources concealed inside the smoothly flowing shipping container, logistics systems function instead through a “kind of radical opacity or invisibility” that partially resists approaches of mapping and examining its supply chains in systematic detail (ch. 6) Meanwhile, the pursuit of capturing a complete inventory of these systems also runs the risk of obscuring their subjective, reflective, and relational properties (ch. 6). 
	
The logic of containerization therefore feeds into the assumptions that have historically informed the dominant development pathways of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which often strive to flatten the complexities of these daily rhythms by reconfiguring them into solvable logistical problems. This tendency is what Kate Crawford and Alex Campolo call “enchanted determinism” (213). AI technology is at once “enchanted” in its capacity for apprehending patterns in the world that are beyond human grasp, yet also deterministic in terms of its conclusions of predictive certainty about the world. On one level, such technologies encode the world, making it “informatically present” to users and consumers, as Alexander Galloway writes (13). Unlike language, however, which, “operates at the level of description and reference” at its most basic and provides a “space of interconnection and deferral of meaning,” these technologies ultimately endeavor to ‘do’ something to the world on a procedural level—even if this form of ‘doing’ is a simulation (22). In this way, the symbolic language of AI can be differentiated between the encoding functions of natural language and a calculus. Here a calculus is a system of reasoning, “an executable machine that can work through a problem, step by step” (22). It follows that to perform a complete "informatic" rendering of the world would thus serve to “erase the world, subjecting it to various forms of manipulation, preemption, modeling and synthetic information” (13). In this scenario, however, it is not that those things constituting this kind of “informatically”-rendered world are erased from existence altogether; rather, worldly referents become “less and less necessary to speak about” as they are materially superseded by the “perfected” language that serves to simulate them so effectively (13).  

Ramji’s poem “Hollarith,” named after Herman Hollarith, the inventor of the electromechanical tabulating machine for punched cards in 1884, demonstrates the tension between the act of encoding the world with natural language, and employing a calculus as a method for shaping the world through systems of reasoning. Similarly to the other poems in the section titled "Surveiller," "Hollarith" also formally reflects the modularity and flat affect of internet discourse and computer code. Lines do not form complete sentences, but are instead predominately detached statements that can be potentially recombined or remixed, not just within each poem, arguably, but also across them. In the case of Hollarith’s tabulating machine, the poem reveals the technology’s inextricable relationship to the Nazi regime, as it facilitated processes of record-keeping related to census data, military resources, and concentration camp capacity. The repetitive litany of seemingly neutral fact statements such as “Nationality,” “Date of birth,” “Marital status,” and “Work skills” shift seamlessly into the words “Gas chamber,” “Gunshot,” and “Hanging,” revealing the extent to which the horrific goals and outcomes of the Holocaust have been latently concealed within mundane processes of social organization (32-33).

Just as the phrase “[c]olumns and punched holes” addresses the paper media through which the tabulation machine operates, the poem also provides access to the logical structure of the punch-card itself (32). The card’s “[s]ixteen categories” open to the multiple punch-holes and codes corresponding to individuals labelled “Jews” and “Homosexuals,” whose deaths (and survival) are condemned to the limited set of ontological possibilities including “Execution,” “Suicide,” “Special handling,” and “Escaped” (32). The poem therefore works to interrogate similar historical processes of technological integration and their unacknowledged social implications. Further, it addresses how the logical framework governing Hollerith’s foundational invention cannot be neatly contained within an analysis of its historical role in past atrocities, given its manifestations in International Business Machines—known today as ‘IBM’—which was founded by Hollerith in 1924 and remains one of the world’s leading computing corporations. 

Collectively, the flat, authoritative language and impersonal perspective of the “Surveiller” poems also echo the ‘enchanted’ yet deterministic calculus that informs discourses on the modern technological marvels they engage with, such as Wi-Fi, satellites, drones, and facial recognition algorithms. Even instances of a collective “we” suggests that the poems’ subjects are interpellated, at least in part, by the protocological structure of advertising hype and internet discourse; an intimate disclosure of the “we,” for instance, that “remembered hugs in the middle of the night” is thus held in tension with the impersonal call to “[s]wipe right to anonymously like” (52). In effect, the poems’ repeated declarative statements start to resemble the rhythms of daily news headlines and digital “content,” the uncanny voice of strategic SEO (search engine optimization) copy, and the unending accumulation of search-query history. Echoing "Hollarith" and its interrogation of the concealed relationship between everyday technologies of tabulation and their facilitation of genocide, the formal structure of the “Surveiller” poems resists the ideological givens of computational logic. Instead, the collective “we”—whether bearing direct or mediated witness to violence, or drawing attention to an absence of accountability and transparency—points, if tentatively, to the lingering potential for ontologies of openness and plasticity. Rather than capitulating entirely to technological inertia and its associated abuses, there remains the possibility of an oppositional “we” capable of turning the medium back on itself— the “we” whose “memory card knows of this event” and claims to “know” the lies that have been buried in the noise (51, 54). In this way, these poems exert pressure on the threat of hyper-logical complacency rather than accept its inevitability.

As these poems oscillate between the abstraction of computation and the materiality of network infrastructure, they reveal the existence of “fragile borders” that delineate these vexed and contradictory relationships between agents (11). The language around ubiquitous network technologies, such as Wi-Fi, for example, frequently imbues these technologies with the power to transcend geographical lines in both magical and hyper-logical (or ‘enchantedly deterministic’) ways. On one hand, a network imaginary is invested in the idea of borders in order to make the claim of having fully transcended them. On the other, the daily operations of these networks must also maintain the imaginary of borders as a means through which to control and classify the flow of both goods and people in service to ongoing capitalist production. 

As Nicole Starosielski writes, twenty-first century media culture is defined through a “cultural imagination of dematerialization,” as contemporary communications are most often represented in the wireless forms of laptops, routers, cellphones, and satellites (6). In fact, outside both the networked and political imaginations in which borders are created to be transcended within a globalized economy, exists a world defined by “firmly demarcated nodes, straight and clear vectors and graph topologies” in the form of submarine communications cables (3). These cable networks are situated in a web of pre-existing territorial affiliations and inequalities, which culminate in terms of their physical precarity, maintenance requirements, and the uneven social access to communications services around the globe. 

The observations made by Ramji’s speaker concerning the geographical, material, and political realities of these fragile borders “not seen when the operator went all systems go” thus confront the fantasies of techno-magical resilience in the face of uncontainable political and environmental crises that persist to threaten network infrastructure (11). Therefore, in order to articulate what it means to live within contemporary conditions of “wirelessness,” it is necessary to acknowledge wireless networks’ layers of material fragilities and contingencies, as well as to accept the reality, as Adrian Mackenzie writes, that while these “intermittent, unstable, and uneven” network connections imply there are fewer wires, “that actually there are more wires” to take into account (9). As Ramji’s poetics employ an aesthetic of “overheard” polyvocality through which poems oscillate formally between aphoristic repetition and elliptical fragmentation, they embody Starosielski’s call to become attuned to networks through instances of interference and turbulence, a shift which aims to expose the contradictory material and social entanglements that constitute them. Rather than conceptualize networks as omniscient or cohesive entities, such strategies guide attention toward the “play[s] of force / in an elsewhere not visible,” thus drawing out an alternative map of relations beyond the grid (6). These poems’ commitment to attending to the invisible and the elsewhere—“the other shore,” which always remains beyond reach—therefore mirrors Mackenzie’s account of networks defined through a multitude of “peripheries and peripherals” that are “vexed by weak connections” (Ramji 6; Mackenzie 7). Such conceptual openings and sensory re-directions, which push beyond prescribed boundaries, therefore present opportunities to challenge and reconfigure network imaginaries anew.

In this way, <i>Port of Being</i> examines the extent to which these myriad layers of networked existence, which have been rendered opaque in everyday life, thus require a paradigm of “double” listening—or making a “listening listened to,” as Peter Szendy writes in the introduction to Listen: A History of Our Ears (5). As it is no longer enough to observe these processes’ relationships to space using vision alone, listening as espionage or “redoubling” configures Ramji’s speaker(s) as agent listeners outside the material and ideological walls surrounding network infrastructures, whose practices of listening produce openings for traversal between surface appearances and their underlying material entanglements (Szendy, All Ears 14). 

Using sonic language to describe this form of movement, Adrian Mackenzie points to the idea of a “transducer,” a device through which the physical nature or medium of a signal can be altered or converted into another. For Mackenzie, thinking “transductively is to mediate between different orders, to place heterogeneous realities in contact, and to become something different” (18). In such a way, these poems can also be understood as transduction devices, as they attend to—and make audible with language—unexamined instances of connection through which network technologies can be rendered anew as simultaneously material and experientially meaningful.
